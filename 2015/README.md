## Run it yourself
### Run a day 
While being at the root directory:
```
go run . [-day=<1-25>] [-input=<file_name>] -year=2015
```
> -day=<1-25> (default:`1`) Specify the day to execute the puzzle `(1-25)`

> -input=<file_name> (default:`input`) Specify the puzzle input file (located at `2015/dayXX/.input/<file_name>`)
### Bench a day
While being at the root directory:
```
go test . -bench [-day=<1-25>] [-input=<file_name>] -year=2015
```
